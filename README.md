% First generate a vector of x points, equally spaced in the interval [0,2.5], and then evaluate erf(x) at those points.

x = (0:0.1:2.5)';

y = erf(x);

% Determine the coefficients of the approximating polynomial of degree 6.

p = polyfit(x,y,6)

% To see how good the fit is, evaluate the polynomial at the data points and generate a table showing the data, fit, and error.

f = polyval(p,x);

T = table(x,y,f,y-f,'VariableNames',{'X','Y','Fit','FitError'})

% In this interval, the interpolated values and the actual values agree fairly closely. Create a plot to show how outside this interval, the extrapolated values quickly diverge from the actual data.

x1 = (0:0.1:5)';

y1 = erf(x1);

f1 = polyval(p,x1);

figure

plot(x,y,'o')

hold on

plot(x1,y1,'-')

plot(x1,f1,'r--')

axis([0  5  0  2])

hold off

I included some posts for reference.
